                     CLI-CONWAY
             A Terminal Implementation of
                  Conway's Game of Life

-----------------------------------------------------

WHAT IS IT?
-----------
CLI-Conway is a text-based version of the
famous Game of Life, created by John Conway.
Navigate, place shapes, and watch as the grid
evolves through generations.

HOW TO INSTALL:
---------------
1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cli-conway.git
2. Navigate into the directory:
   cd cli-conway
3. Install dependencies:
   npm install
4. Run the game:
   npm start

OR install globally with npm:
   npm install -g cli-conway

-----------------------------------------------------

COMMANDS:
---------
Use the arrow keys to move the cursor.
Press:
  SPACE   - Toggle cell state
  ESC/Q   - Exit
  1-9     - Adjust simulation speed
  [g, b, p, h, l, v, o, t, u, s, x, c] - Place shapes

-----------------------------------------------------

TIPS:
-----
- Use `1` for the slowest speed (450ms) and `9` for the fastest (50ms).
- Place multiple shapes in quick succession for interesting patterns!

COMMON SHAPE COMBOS:
- **Glider (g) + Blinker (b)**: Create moving patterns with gliders and blinking cells.
- **Gosper Glider Gun**: Use `g` and `l` together to create a glider gun setup (requires precise placement).
- **Pulsar (p)**: A great way to create oscillating patterns â€” try combining this with other still life shapes!
